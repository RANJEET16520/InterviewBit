Problem:
You are given an array A containing N integers. The special product of each ith integer in this array is defined as the product of the following:

1. LeftSpecialValue: For an index i, it is defined as the index j such that A[j]>A[i] (i>j). 
If multiple A[j]â€™s are present in multiple positions, the LeftSpecialValue is the maximum value of j.

2. RightSpecialValue: For an index i, it is defined as the index j such that A[j]>A[i] (j>i). 
If multiple A[j]s are present in multiple positions, the RightSpecialValue is the minimum value of j.

Write a program to find the maximum special product of any integer in the array.
Input: You will receive array of integers as argument to function.
Return: Maximum special product of any integer in the array modulo 1000000007.

Note: If j does not exist, the LeftSpecialValue and RightSpecialValue are considered to be 0.

Constraints 1 <= N <= 10^5 1 <= A[i] <= 10^9
